Technology Compatibility: Risk of compatibility issues between different technologies, such as Angular, Django, and MySQL, leading to integration challenges and delays in development.

Data Security: Risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the MySQL database, potentially resulting in loss of data or compromised user privacy.

Performance and Scalability: Risk of poor performance or scalability issues as the project grows in terms of user base or data volume, leading to slow response times or system failures.

Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries: Risk of dependencies on external libraries or plugins, which may introduce vulnerabilities or compatibility issues, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.

Version Control and Collaboration: Risk of conflicts and difficulties in managing code changes and collaborating effectively among team members using GitHub, potentially resulting in code inconsistencies or delays in development.

User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Risk of poor UI/UX design, leading to a suboptimal user experience, decreased user engagement, and negative feedback from users.

Deployment and Hosting: Risk of issues during deployment and hosting of the application on the OVH platform, such as configuration errors or compatibility issues with the hosting environment.

Project Management: Risk of delays, scope creep, or resource constraints that can impact the overall timeline and successful completion of the project.
