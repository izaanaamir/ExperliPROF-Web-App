# ExperliPROF Web Application
EXPERLIPROF is a groundbreaking web application designed to streamline the activities of freelance teachers who work with multiple schools independently. The primary objective of this innovative platform is to facilitate the planning, management, and data extraction processes for honorary teachers. By providing a comprehensive and multidimensional view, EXPERLIPROF empowers teachers to efficiently oversee students, training sessions, and interventions in schools, while generating valuable annual statistics.

A vital aspect of the project is the implementation of an innovative business intelligence interface. This interface will empower users to create predefined states, generate on-demand reports, and effortlessly query the database. It will also feature configurability and accessibility for all users, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience. Furthermore, the application will be designed to support multiple languages, enabling easy translation and adaptation to diverse linguistic requirements.

In terms of sustainability, EXPERLIPROF aims to be easily maintainable and scalable, accommodating future growth and potential changes. Additional features can also be considered during the project, such as the extraction of notes and attendance in Excel and PDF formats, creation of schedules, checklist of recurring tasks, inclusion of documents, and generation of various reports. These supplementary functionalities will enhance the overall user experience and provide comprehensive support for teachers' needs.

With its unique and comprehensive approach, the EXPERLIPROF project represents a significant innovation in the field, as no existing application fulfills the same requirements. The project necessitates an agile development approach and active collaboration with EXPERLIGENCE throughout the entire process to ensure its success.
